The Path of the Vigilant
===

## Game Summary:
You're the commander of the Vigilant, one of Earth's last battleships, charged with leading and protecting an evacuation fleet as they venture towards E2-C223 to begin civilization anew.  As the fleet of ships jump from point to point through space, you are attacked!  In the chaos, the individual captains of each transport ship scatter without regard for the rest of the fleet and flee through space using unique escape vectors.  Your mission still stands, though amended .. Find the missing transport ships and lead them to their new  home!

## Core Mechanics:
- Manipulate the game board such that there are three or more adjacent tiles (horizontal or vertical) with matching icons
- Boost or repair the ship's systems depending on which tiles were matched and the current active view (general, tactical, engineering, etc.)

## Gameplay:
Your ship, the Vigilant, has just entered a region of space.  The Vigilant's scanners begin powering up to search nearby for any missing ships from the evacuation fleet.  Simultaneously, the Vigilant's shields and weapons begin to charge along with the the Vigilant's hyper-propulsion engines.  You have a feeling that this is a dangerous section of space, so you prioritize matching tactical and defensive tiles to accelerate the readiness of those systems in the event that you need them.  As suspected, enemy ships appear nearby and fighting commences.  As you fire on the enemy, your weapons need to be recharged (matching tactical tiles boosts the charge speed/rate).  As you take damage, shields need to be recharged and the ship itself needs to be repaired (defensive and engineering tiles, respectively).  During the engagement with the enemy ship, the Vigilant's scanners pick up what could be a possible signal from one of the missing ships from the evac fleet (the scanners have been charging and scanning regularly with additional boosts from matching astrometrics tiles).  Now, you have a decision to make.  Continue the engagement with the enemy or ready the Vigilant's engines (navigation or engineering tiles) and jump to the signal you just scanned.  The risk of continuing the fight (on top of the risk you might lose) is that the scanned signal might degrade to a point where it's no longer detectable.  A big risk of jumping to the signal is that the enemy might follow an endanger the evacuation ship you're tasked to escort .. _**if**_ the signal scanned even belonged to an evacuation ship.

## Music:
The music for most parts of the game should be moderately paced.  The tempo should increase during combat engagements.  The tempo should decrease for moments of loss (evac ship lost forever or destroyed).  The style I think should be chiptune-y .. similar to the music in _Faster Than Light_.

Scope Check
===

This is the longest and also the most important assignment in the course. It will more or less determine whether you finish with a game you can be proud of. It isn’t homework that someone is making you do – it’s what happens at the beginning of every successful game project, at any scale. You’ll continue to do this for all your games once you’ve learned how.

The document you create will help keep you on track for the rest of the course so you can finish your game.

Write down your answer under each question. There’s a lot of text in the questions, but you won’t actually need to write much in your answers. You can probably do each section (there are three) in twenty minutes.


## Part 1: Visualization and Implementation

### Visualization

Start by imagining that you are playing the game. Imagine choosing a specific goal, for example:
⦁	to land on an island in a flying game
⦁	to defeat a turret-type enemy in a space shooter
⦁	to place a tower in the right place to defeat a slow but tough enemy

Answer these questions based on the moment you have sketched (not the whole game).

⦁	Visualize what’s on the screen and make a rough sketch of the sequence. Paste a picture of your sketch here:


⦁	Write down everything you see on the screen. Don’t forget things like background art, a score or a timer.


⦁	Write down a list of everything that moves or changes. Are there visual effects, like blinking an enemy red to show damage? Are there sound effects, like a “thump” for placing a tower?


⦁	Write down a separate list breaking down each step of what the player is doing, and what happens in response. How do you tell the game what you want to do? (For example, click to move or press ‘E’ to charge shrink ray.) How does the game tell you you’re making progress (or not)?

### Implementation

⦁	Imagine how you would write the code for each thing in your last two lists (things that move and player interactions/feedback).
⦁	Have you done anything like it before? Is there code from previous projects that you could copy and adapt, rather than starting from scratch?

⦁	Do you know of a tutorial or asset pack that could take care of some of the functionality for you? Paste the links here.

⦁	Do you have friends or classmates in this course who can help you with these tasks?


⦁	Write down your three biggest coding questions, e.g. “how to make one-way platforms” or “how to make the tower icon move with the mouse”.


⦁	Go to answers.unity3d.com and look for answers for your questions. Did you find answers? Did you generally understand the answers or did they use a lot of unfamiliar vocabulary?


⦁	Make a list of every visual and audio asset in the sequence (i.e. you don’t need to think about the whole game). Be thorough – don’t forget things like animations and particles, or UI elements like score.
⦁	Type your list here.

⦁	If you plan to make any assets, take half an hour and try to make one or two sample assets. Paste the results here. Can you get them to a reasonable degree of quality in that time?

⦁	If you plan to find some or all of them online, take half an hour and try to find every element in your sequence (environment, character, UI font, etc.) in a matching art style. Try to find a couple of audio assets too. Paste a few of the images here, and note the ones you couldn’t find.

## Part 2: Scale, Challenges and Resources

### Scale

Now step back from that sequence mentally and think about the whole game. Think about all the parts of the game that can be numbered and grouped. For example:
⦁	3 levels
⦁	5 power-ups
⦁	2 enemy types
⦁	6 places to place towers	⦁	4 foundation piles for cards
⦁	6 matchable objects for a match-three
⦁	3 jumping puzzles

⦁	Make a list. Go ahead and put down a number for each that seems reasonable.

⦁	Mentally cut each number in half. Is the game still playable? Does it still create your core experience? Now try reducing each number to one, and ask yourself the same questions.
Write down your final list, with numbers, here.

### Challenges

Based on all of the above, write down the top three challenges you foresee in the process of making your game over the next few weeks. Be specific, and phrase them as questions. These are examples of answers that are too vague to be useful to you:
⦁	“I’m not sure I’m good enough at coding”
⦁	“I don’t know where I’ll get all the art”
⦁	“I might run out of time”

These are examples of useful questions:
⦁	“How can I make my elemental system clear to the player?”
⦁	“How can I tell whether an enemy can see the player?”
⦁	“Can I find pixel-art environment assets to match the characters I’ve found?”

⦁	Write your questions here.

### Resources

⦁	The most important resource is your own time. Look at your calendar for weeks 4-8 of the course (a total of five weeks). For each week, write down the smallest number of hours that you can safely commit to, given your other commitments and interests. Do not assume you can spend every waking hour on your game for six weeks.

Now subtract 25% of the number for each week because things happen – vet appointments, traffic, hay fever, friends needing favors, accidentally sleeping in, etc.

Write down the total number of hours for all five weeks here.


⦁	Next, paste in links to three or more specific tutorials that will help you make your game. Don’t just write down the top three search results – watch parts of them and make sure they’re relevant to what you want to do.
Part 3: Reality Check

### Assessment

⦁	Look at your challenges and your resources. Do you feel confident you can make a fun game based on this concept by the end of the course? If so, write a sentence explaining why. If not, this is your chance to rethink your choice of game for this course. Go update your concept doc and your answers above – but save your first idea for the future!



Doing a scope check is difficult, and not much fun. But it’s the foundation of good design. When you know what the core of your experience is, you know what to build first and you won’t get lost in building unnecessary features or assets. You’ll also end up with a game that feels intentional and elegant, because every element will contribute to the whole.

But most importantly, you’re laying the groundwork you will need to finish your game.
